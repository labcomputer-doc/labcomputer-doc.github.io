###############################################

Once you have launched the created course, you may start to develop the assignments for the students. With this section, we go over the steps to create the assignment. These steps consist of preparing the Jupyter Notebook as an assignment with the Formgrader tab.

Once you are located within Formgrader, click on + Add new assignment to create a new assignment name. Once an assignment is created, a link is added to the assignment, visible within the Name column:
