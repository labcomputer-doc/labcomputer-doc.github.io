Validate the Assignment
########################

Nbgrader extensions for Jupyter notebook includes a Validate button  to make sure that all tests pass. You can, of course, run the cells in order and obtain the same level of validation, but the **Validate** button provides a one-click and only focuses on the Autograded tests that assert results located within the Autograded answers. This step will ensure that the nbgrader will not encounter unexpected errors and return inaccurate results when calculating grades.
