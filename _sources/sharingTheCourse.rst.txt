Sharing the course to students
################################

When you are done with assignments for the course, you may share them to students. Before sharing, you need to go back to the Courses Manager panel and click “SAVE” on the corresponding course. And only after that, you may share your course. 
    
And to do this, click an icon on the upper right of the corresponding course and select **the Share control** in the drop-down list.
