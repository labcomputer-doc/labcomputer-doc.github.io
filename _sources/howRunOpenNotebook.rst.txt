How to run and open Notebook?
###############################

As you might know, the Jupyter notebook runs within a web browser. However, before you open a web browser and start using Jupyter notebook, you need to install it. 
Lab.computer provides an already installed environment for running the Notebook and there is no need to spend much time on getting stuff installed and setting them up. 
The Notebook itself is accessible by one click. Just click on the **New dropdown menu** and youâ€™ll see the following options:

    :align: center
    :alt: python 3

Select option **Python 3** to open a new Notebook for Python.
