A Launched Course
##################

After running the course by pressing the self-titled button, you get the launched course with three feature buttons. Let's check out at them:

After clicking the **“Connect”**, you have to type the password entered during the course creation. And then you may start working in a notebook and use the other functionalities of the dashboard. 

Sharing course with the latest added material is only possible after going back to the Course Manager panel and clicking **“SAVE”** on the corresponding course. 

Only one course can be launched at a time. Thus, you have to **"Stop"** one course to launch the next one, otherwise the error notification is shown.
