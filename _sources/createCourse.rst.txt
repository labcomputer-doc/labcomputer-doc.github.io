Creating a Course
###################

Creating a course is the first thing needed to do to get started on Сomputer.lab. To begin, click the “Create a Course” button on the upper right of the corner.
The Course Name and Course Password only details need to be entered in the “Create a Course” modal.

The course configuration may take up to a few minutes. In the case of the course failure, there are two possible ways of moving forward. The first option would be to delete the course and create it from scratch.  As to the second option, you may click the “Stop” button. After stopping, launch the course again and the configuration process will restart. 
Note: Currently, there is no option of resetting the password and editing the fields. Be careful with entering a title of the course and choosing a password.
